                <p>
                    hi im azzy <span class="imachild">im a child</span> i really found an intrest in coding and i thought a good idea would be to learn web development first then get into actual game development. so over the past like couple months its been now that ive been learning html, this is my first public site. ever since i got my laptop for christmas ive been able to explore on some hobbies that ive wanted to try for a while, like 2d animation, 3d modeling and art, and development, working on this site has also gotten me to learn some more about making graphics and using different softwares to achieve what i want and i learned alot in doing so. i still prefer traditional art over digital cus its all im used to and it means more to me but i hope to get more comfortable with digital drawing soon! its been fun but time consuming to try these sofwares that im learning for the first time. i also like to crochet, sew, sculpt, cook, bake, and play games so obviously with all these ideas (and school on top of it(and soon a job probably)) and so little time its kinda hard to find time to learn ALLLLL these things and progress will be slower because of the ammount of things i want to do.. especially cus im learning it all for the first time! but my passion has always been with art and creativity soo i hope u like this site, its not much now but it will be updated as i learn more and stuff like that :3

                raaaa i just got home from a week vacation :3 it was fun and soo different… so ive been relaxing, and still worrying but a little less.. it felt bad doing nothing.. and now i have a job!! its just over the summer tho, but its a good opportunity and ill still have time to do all the fun stuff i love to do!
i also got a new guestbook, cus 123 guestbook is shutting down july 1st :( im sad… WHY NOW!!? but i am also super excited about how i got the f12 counter to work thanks to a guy on stackoverflow lol hes my hero… but i still cant seem to count out my visits :b so everytime i refresh the page while im editing it, it counts as 1 lol…
i also pushed out a new video, its been over a month, but its my longest video yet at 52 mins, and it took a while to make…but omg it got 30 views in a day!! lol but now that thats out of the way, im excited to make other (shorter..) videos lol 
and soon one with my funky voice…

            <h4>5/6/24</h4>
            <p>
                hello! 
ive been doing rlly good recently, i had some really good news in the middle of April, i got accepted into a program that i really wanted to get! its basically an early collage program where u can get certified for different things, but its super competitive with kids from like 26 other schools competing! thatll be next year and im super excited, its a digital media thing so ill be able to learn a whole lot. also  since we only have like a month left in school, ill have alot of time to do so much stuff! im excited. even tho i am excited, i think im gonna miss school a little. or maybe i think the time is going by so fast. but anyways, my bday was super great! i loved spending time with family, we went to the zoo and im an ipad kid now loll and i got a very cute clefairy squishmallow. and a gengar plush i have alot of stuff going on outside of just my hobbies to do too obv, i am learning to drive, and im working on getting a job over summer since im of age and im working on some other things about myself. it stresses me a little but itll turn out fine, i want to focus on my youtube more, especially over summer, and make some vids and use my voice. i always hated how i sounded on video tho :p but ill try not to think abt it too hard, ive also been thinking of a website to post my art on besides my website and also a place to share stuff,, i dont rlly want to do twt or deviant art bc of their communities,twt is just a spooky place... but i was also thinking tumblr, insta maybe?? idk. but ill try to figure it out! i dont even rlly go on social media alot.so idk how id be able to keep up w social media engagement and stuff, like i recently have been cutting down on insta and insta reels for my own good lol, i already stopped using TikTok like a year ago, so yea  doomscrolling is BAD. and theres better stuff to be done (is what i say to myself).. ive also still been learning javascript, i havnt been so consistent with it tho :( but i enjoy it 
            </p>
            <h4>4/14/24</h4>
            <p>my bday is so soon!  only like 2 weeks away. also i finally FINALLY found out how to make a music player, although its not like auto playing music, i still love it ive had a cold and have been kinda miserable for a few days but i feel better now.  the weather has been getting better and its making me happy.  
            i made a guestbook and a status thing! and adding more fun things to my site and discovoring stuff. i have alot of ideas 
            ive also been learning javascript, its kinda hard, harder than html and css lol cus it has logic and stuff. but i didnt find html and css that hard, but i remember the beginning. i knew absolutely nothing, and it was so hard just to get started but eventually everything just started to click for me and it was super fun, so i hope that happens for me again with javascript i dont really understand enough javascript at all rn to use it on my own but its still fun to learn this stuff and exciting to soon be able to bring more possibilities into my website to make it more interactive :3
            so when i make this blog, im not sure if i want it to just be about my website and website journey or whatever, or about more personal stuff, when i first started this website i was focusing on this and really nothing else, but now im kinda slowing down on it because i have other passions, and ive been feeling like i dont manage my time around my hobbies that good and i get distracted easily and since im teaching myself all this and being so new and i dont have it all scheduled like a school it gets frustrating when i want to do so much but dont have all the time. i know i overthink alot but i think ill be fine, i havnt worked on my site in a little while, but id like to get back to it !!</p>
            
            <h4>4/6/24</h4>
            <p>my site is officially published! i have been working on this for about over a week, ive been coming home from school and just working on this site for like hours straight lol. and im really happy how its turned out,  mind u this is just the beginning of what my site will be, im super excited to add more and more. im working on adding an art page. and i wanna know how to add autoplay music?? cuz youtube links dont work anymore :p, but anyways i hope u come back, also feel free to leave a msg in the chatbox! id love to hear from u guys! </p>
