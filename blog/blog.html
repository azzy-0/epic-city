            hellowowwwwww guys!!!! its been a while :0 so school just started again and i had a nice summer!!! 
so having a summer job was fun, i got to get alot of stuff for myself but also have alot of money left over to save! i hope i can get another job over the school year, and that having that summer job makes it easier to find one. 
So some stuff i got over summer wasssss <br>
A PS2 !!! i made a video about all i got on my channel <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y82Wr0JlWGg?si=XsQ2sHLC0Je3Ntpb" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>
but yea im really happy with it all
another thing that i did over summer was got into rpg maker!!! i knew about rpg maker before, but i saw that it costed money so i set it aside for some other time. but when i had money from my job, i gave it a look anddd i got rpg maker mv and 2003!!<br>
the best thing about it is that i got rpgmaker for a HUUUUGE discount.. so originally it was $80 (yea absolutely not) but i got it on steam for like $12 when it was on a 80% discount!! i also got rpgmaker 2003 for like $3 lol. but that was one of my favorite parts of summer, learning how to use rpgmaker and getting to make my own sprites and graphics and all, i thought it was really cool learning how omori was made in rpgmaker.. and ngl i use rpg maker 2003 now more than mv lol. i like how its more simple, i made a little test game and put it on itch.io in rpgmaker mv, but now im working on a game in rpgmaker 2003, where it uses allll my own graphics and everything (i got aesprite)<br> 
i ALSO got a ps4!!!!,:D  an yea ive always been an xbox lover i was raised on it lol but getting to set up a new console was so exciting, and i made it yakuza themed !! and i got to play little big planet 3 again! it was so exciting to play little big planet again for the first time in years.. although im really sad about the servers shutting down :( cus most of the fun was definitely in playing other peoples maps.. but oh well. (also a big plus is using a wireless controller)<br>

i also moved! kinda, i still live in the same area. but we have a new hoise and a got a cool room :D its a little small but i like it and plus ill be going to college in a few years anyways, but its been nice getting to decorate and stuff.<br>
SOOOOO i had a pretty busy and fun summer, im excited for  the future and making videos and everything(i did make an intro yt vid with my voice..AHHHHHHHHHHH <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O_jAdwS0_FA?si=yq2xIaFow9YIYpiO" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>) <br>sooo yea look forward to more!!!!!

                i also got a new guestbook, cus 123 guestbook is shutting down july 1st :( im sad… WHY NOW!!? but i am also super excited about how i got the f12 counter to work thanks to a guy on stackoverflow lol hes my hero… but i still cant seem to count out my visits :b so everytime i refresh the page while im editing it, it counts as 1 lol…
                i also pushed out a new video, its been over a month, but its my longest video yet at 52 mins, and it took a while to make…but omg it got 30 views in a day!! lol but now that thats out of the way, im excited to make other (shorter..) videos lol 
                and soon one with my funky voice…

                hello! 
            ive been doing rlly good recently, i had some really good news in the middle of April, i got accepted into a program that i really wanted to get! its basically an early collage program where u can get certified for different things, but its super competitive with kids from like 26 other schools competing! thatll be next year and im super excited, its a digital media thing so ill be able to learn a whole lot. also  since we only have like a month left in school, ill have alot of time to do so much stuff! im excited. even tho i am excited, i think im gonna miss school a little. or maybe i think the time is going by so fast. but anyways, my bday was super great! i loved spending time with family, we went to the zoo and im an ipad kid now loll and i got a very cute clefairy squishmallow. and a gengar plush i have alot of stuff going on outside of just my hobbies to do too obv, i am learning to drive, and im working on getting a job over summer since im of age and im working on some other things about myself. it stresses me a little but itll turn out fine, i want to focus on my youtube more, especially over summer, and make some vids and use my voice. i always hated how i sounded on video tho :p but ill try not to think abt it too hard, ive also been thinking of a website to post my art on besides my website and also a place to share stuff,, i dont rlly want to do twt or deviant art bc of their communities,twt is just a spooky place... but i was also thinking tumblr, insta maybe?? idk. but ill try to figure it out! i dont even rlly go on social media alot.so idk how id be able to keep up w social media engagement and stuff, like i recently have been cutting down on insta and insta reels for my own good lol, i already stopped using TikTok like a year ago, so yea  doomscrolling is BAD. and theres better stuff to be done (is what i say to myself).. ive also still been learning javascript, i havnt been so consistent with it tho :( but i enjoy it 
            </p>
            <h4>4/14/24</h4>
            <p>my bday is so soon!  only like 2 weeks away. also i finally FINALLY found out how to make a music player, although its not like auto playing music, i still love it ive had a cold and have been kinda miserable for a few days but i feel better now.  the weather has been getting better and its making me happy.  
            i made a guestbook and a status thing! and adding more fun things to my site and discovoring stuff. i have alot of ideas 
            ive also been learning javascript, its kinda hard, harder than html and css lol cus it has logic and stuff. but i didnt find html and css that hard, but i remember the beginning. i knew absolutely nothing, and it was so hard just to get started but eventually everything just started to click for me and it was super fun, so i hope that happens for me again with javascript i dont really understand enough javascript at all rn to use it on my own but its still fun to learn this stuff and exciting to soon be able to bring more possibilities into my website to make it more interactive :3
            so when i make this blog, im not sure if i want it to just be about my website and website journey or whatever, or about more personal stuff, when i first started this website i was focusing on this and really nothing else, but now im kinda slowing down on it because i have other passions, and ive been feeling like i dont manage my time around my hobbies that good and i get distracted easily and since im teaching myself all this and being so new and i dont have it all scheduled like a school it gets frustrating when i want to do so much but dont have all the time. i know i overthink alot but i think ill be fine, i havnt worked on my site in a little while, but id like to get back to it !!
            </p>
