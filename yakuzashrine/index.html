                ive been playing the yakuza series for a while and ive only finished yakuza 0 and kiwami and now 100%ing yakuza 0 before i  move onto the yakuza kiwami 2, and even though ive only played 2 games so far, its become my favorite game ever. its a masterpiece. its funny, emotional, and has an AMAZING story. ive cried at both endings to the games. yakuza 0 is my favorite of the 2 right now, idk how it can get better than that. i heard that judgement is amazing too, im playing the games in order so it will take a while, but ill continue to update, maybe ill have some rants here about the game too as i play them cus i dont really know anyone else who plays the game lol but i just really wanted to make a yakuza dedicated page<span>4-6-24</span>
